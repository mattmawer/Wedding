tagline = "May 18th 2019"

Day [schedule](/schedule) and [Tableplan](/2019-05-09_Final table plan.pdf) are now both available. A few people have also asked us about [wedding gifts](/gifts), so I have finally updated the link below with more information.

There is no specific dress code. Smart casual is our advice. Please wear something comfortable: it's a party, not a job interview.
