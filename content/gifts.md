There is absolutely no expectation that any of our guests should offer wedding gifts. Your company to share in our celebration is enough.

In practice, we recognise that some guests will *expect* to leave a gift. It is a very kind gesture and we appreciate it. If this applies to you, please just leave us a small amount of money or a high street voucher (e.g. John Lewis) in a card. Likewise, if you want to leave us a message in a card then please bring it on the day: there will be a postbox at the venue.

We would prefer this to physical gifts on the day. Firstly because space to store them at the venue will be limited, and secondly because we have lived together for 7 years and have all the tea towels and Doulton dinnerware we need....
