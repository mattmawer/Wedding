Sarah's car will be arriving at Quarry Bank at about 15:45.

#### **Arriving**
Please allow *at least* 10 minutes to get from the car park at Quarry Bank Mill to the ceremony room. It is short walk down a fairly steep hill: visitor cars cannot drive to the Mill entrance. There is a golf cart 'hopper' service available to ferry people down the hill, but obviously allow extra time if you intend to use this. 

If in doubt, arrive early. Quarry Bank is open as a National Trust property until 17:00, so you can tell front reception you are here for a wedding and then go admire the giant rhubarb or the weir for half an hour if necessary...

#### **Leaving**

Once the property is closed for public access (>17:00), taxis are able to come down the hill to the Mill entrance. There are lots of Taxi firms (plus Uber), but if you need a starter then [Trafftax Taxis](http://www.trafftaxtaxis.co.uk/) operate in the local area.

#### **Other stuff**
If the weather is fine, the drinks reception will be outside on the Tennis Lawn. If you are planning to come in (high) heels, please bear in mind that we will be on grass and there are also some cobblestone paths around the Mill building.
